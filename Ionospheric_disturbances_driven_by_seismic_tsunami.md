Ionospheric disturbances driven by seismic tsunami-excited gravity waves

1.  Introduction

Big earthquakes and tsunamis can excite acoustic resonance between the
earth or ocean surface and the lower atmosphere. Owing to the wave
amplitude increase against the decrease of the atmosphere density and
makes the upper atmosphere a good medium to propagate the gravity waves.
Some of the resonance waves leaks upward into the ionosphere and trigger
ionospheric anomalies which can be observed as traveling ionospheric
disturbances (TIDs). These TIDs generated by ocean waves was first
established by Daniels and the theory was developed by Hines. There are
different methods to detect these TIDs, including radar altimeter,
incoherent scatter radar, ground-based GPS network. In addition, the
ionospheric data from radio occultation which is performed between a GPS
satellite and a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite was applied to detect
the ionospheric disturbances following the 11 March 2011 earthquake and
tsunami off coast of Tohoku by Piedavide et al (2014). The gravity waves
were also detected in neutral atmosphere by the Gravity Field and
Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) satellite with low
orbiting altitude of 250km \[Carcia et al., 2014\].

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a powerful tool to analyze the
atmospheric or ionospheric response to the earthquakes and tsunamis
especially for regions with dense GPS continuous operating stations.
There are delays caused by the tropospheric and ionospheric refraction
when the GPS signals path through the atmosphere of Earth. The delays
include lengthening of the geometric path and variation of signal\'s
group velocity and phase velocity. The differences between
dual-frequency carrier phase (L1 and L2) observations contain the
information of ionosphere including TEC. When signal travelling through
the atmosphere or ionosphere, the frequency of the signal will be
affected by the neutral gas and ionospheric plasma. GPS-TEC was first
used as a sensor to analysis the solid Earth \[Calais and
Minster,1995\]. Later GPS-TEC was applied into earthquake and tsunami
study. For instance, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and 2011 Japan earthquake
and tsunami were studied and a detailed method of GPS-TEC was introduced
by Shuanggen Jin et al (2015).

The ionospheric anomalies after the earthquakes or tsunamis were widely
analyzed based on GPS-TEC, firstly the TEC anomalies following the
earthquake were widely known as a N-shape disturbance \[Heki et al.
2006\]. Later the TEC disturbances following earthquakes and tsunamis
were found to be more complicated and have different modes with
different features. Heki et al. reported that the seismic ionospheric
disturbance following the great Sumatra earthquake in 2004 was mainly
related to the direct acoustic wave from the focal area, tsunami induced
gravity wave and secondary acoustic wave exited by the Rayleigh wave in
the far field. The results of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan also
showed three modes with different propagation velocities, which include
tsunami generated gravity waves (0.1-0.3 km/s), acoustic waves (0.3-1.5
km/s) and seismic Rayleigh waves (2-3 km/s).

The features including velocities, propagating direction, amplitude and
so on of TEC anomalies were widely studied by researchers in the last
decade. And then more attention was paid to understanding the coupling
mechanism between the tsunami and ionosphere. Three-dimensional model of
ocean-wave disturbances triggered by earthquakes and tsunamis, the
one-dimensional model of atmospheric gravity wave propagation and the
one-dimensional model of ionospheric response to the earthquakes and
tsunamis are combined by Occhipinti et al (2006) to simulate the
ionospheric disturbances following the 2004 Sumatra tsunami. And the
perturbation results were compared with the TEC observations obtained
from Jason-1 and Topex-Position satellites and there were good agreement
between the model simulations and satellite observations. However, the
influence of atmospheric viscosity on the propagation of gravity waves
is not considered in the simulation, which makes the velocity of
disturbance not consistent with the fact, and the vertical and
horizontal wind fields perturb the velocity to 600 m /s. Occhipinti et
al (2008) simulated the ionospheric response to heavy waves at different
latitudes. And their results demonstrate that the coupling of neutral
and ionospheric ions in low latitudes was significantly stronger than
that in mid-latitudes.

The coupling between the tsunamis and ionosphere is complicated and
there are many factors should not be ignored. Hickey et al proposed that
the influence of Coriolis force, atmospheric viscosity and background
wind field should be taken into consideration when simulating the
tsunami-induced interaction of gravity waves with the ionosphere. The
ionospheric disturbances of the gravity waves generated by Japan's
tsunami in 2011, and they found that different wave propagation
directions and horizontal wind fields related to the depth of the ocean
also contribute to the upward propagation of the gravity waves.
Therefore, the simulation of the ionospheric disturbances triggered by
tsunami-induced atmospheric gravity waves should take full account of
atmospheric viscosity and background wind and other natural physical
processes, as well as wave propagation direction and geomagnetic
properties.

It can be seen that the current research on the ionospheric disturbances
caused by the gravity wave include observation data analysis and
numerical simulation. Scientists compare the simulated data with
observed data to help understand the actual propagation of gravity waves
and their perturbations in the ionosphere. Galvan et al (2016) used the
coupled model of atmosphere and ionosphere and the Song model to
simulate the ionospheric disturbance caused by the atmospheric gravity
wave triggered by the Japan tsunami in 2011. And combined the modeling
results with the TEC perturbation time series from GPS observation data
of Japan\'s GEONET network. It is found that the maximum disturbance
caused by the Japanese tsunami in the ionosphere is 1.5 TECU in the
southeast direction.

Although researchers made many progress in this field, the core
scientific problems regarding the nature of the coupling between the
ocean and ionosphere are still not sufficiently understood and let alone
the accurate tsunami warning. The tsunamis can cause great damage to
human beings, about 20 thousand people died because of the 2011 tsunami
of Japan. Dense scientific observation network is equipped in Japan,
while the present tsunami forecasting systems are not effective.
Traditional forecasting system based on the long-period waves cost too
much time to calculate the accurate information of the rapture area and
it is hard to predict the near-field tsunami. And density network of
offshore monitoring for tsunami using GPS buoys and ocean-pressure
gauges required a large budget and human power. While the TEC
disturbances could be detected about 10-20 min after the main shock and
the high speed of the development of GPS network which make ground-GPS
observations processed in real-time may have the potential to enhance
the current system by independently providing the tsunami speeds and
amplitude.

2.  Theory and Methods

TEC can be easily derived from GPS dual-frequency observations. The GPS
equation of carrier phase and code observations are as follows
(Shuanggen Jin et al,2015):

in which k=1,2 represent dual-frequency carrier phase. L is the carrier
phase measurement, P is the code measurement, is the true distance
between the GPS satellite and receiver, and are ionospheric delay and
tropspheric delay respectively, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is
the clock error, b is the phase advance of instrument bias, d is the
code delay of instrument bias, N is the ambiguity of the carrier phase,
and is residuals in the GPS measurement.

The delay when GPS signals travel through the ionosphere is

and the TEC is expressed as:

The difference of the dual-frequency phase and code observations contain
the information of the ionospheric delay, and the TEC can be calculated
by the following equation(Shuanggen Jin et al,2015):

or

Before estimating the STEC, the cycle slips must be detected and
repaired to get clean GPS observations, here we use a second-order and
time-difference phase ionospheric residual(STPIR) algorithm (Cai et al.,
2013). Besides we consider the instrument bias, ambiguity of the carrier
phase and residuals as constants for one continuous arc and can be
ignored because that we pay more attention to the disturbance of TEC
instead of the absolute TEC. After obtaining the TEC series, the
variations of TEC series can be derived by smoothing the original TEC
series or calculating the gradient of the TEC series. In our work, the
four-order zero-phase Butterworth band-pass filter with cutoffs at 3mHz
and 8 mHz was applied to isolate the acoustic component of TEC
perturbation(Thomas Dautermann et a., 2008).
